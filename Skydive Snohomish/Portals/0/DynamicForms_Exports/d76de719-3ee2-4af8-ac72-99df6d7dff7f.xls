I was interested to know if setting up a weblog such your own:  is difficult to do for unskilled people? I have been wanting to set up my own website for a while now but have been turned off because I've always believed it demanded tons of work. What do you think? Thanks alot :)

I was wondering if (weather permitting) you guys operate year-round and how one would best divide jumps and courses (weekends, single block of time, etc.) to obtain an A rating. Thank you and have a wonderful day.    Jake Wiborg

I'm starting a blog soon but have no coding knowledge so I wanted to get advice from someone with experience. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

There is a young man going to jump tomorrow at your club and I was talking to him and I mentioned that I thought when you free fall you fall 120 feet per second.  He said no and of course it has been along time since my husband jumped before he passed away.  I just wanted to know if I was right.  My husband held a D license and I think it was D-123.  Anyway I got all excited when this young man said he was going to jump.  Brings back old memories.  Thank you for listening to me.  Carolyn
