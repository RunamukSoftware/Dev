There is a young man going to jump tomorrow at your club and I was talking to him and I mentioned that I thought when you free fall you fall 120 feet per second.  He said no and of course it has been along time since my husband jumped before he passed away.  I just wanted to know if I was right.  My husband held a D license and I think it was D-123.  Anyway I got all excited when this young man said he was going to jump.  Brings back old memories.  Thank you for listening to me.  Carolyn

I see your domain name, " has the www and my web address looks like, "http://mydomain.com". Do you know how I can alter this? I'm using Wordpress. Warm regards
