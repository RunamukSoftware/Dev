      <question><![CDATA[What are the differences between Tandem and Static Line Instruction and jumping? ]]></question>
      <answer><![CDATA[The tandem jump facilitates one on one hands on instruction with the experience of freefall and the security of knowing your instructor is on board with you. Under Tandem however, you lack the ability to maintain and experience full control of the canopy and exit on your own. The Static Line Jump allows the student full control of the canopy. Because you are connected to the aircraft by static line, you will not experience freefall, but you are able to exit the aircraft and guide your canopy to the ground on your own. Static line training is performed in a group setting with the exception of the one-on-one Talk-down into the student field after exiting the airplane. The goal of both programs is to satisfy the course requirements and to develop the skills necessary to obtain your Basic Skydivers (A Class) License.]]></answer>

      <question><![CDATA[How does the extra altitude benefit me?]]></question>
      <answer><![CDATA[The freefall portion of the skydive is the primary environment in which most of the learning occurs. If you choose the 12,000 foot skydive you will DOUBLE your freefall time from 30 seconds to one full minute, hence increasing the learning time. The additional free fall time is almost like getting another skydive for a fraction of the cost.]]></answer>

      <question><![CDATA[How long does the skydive last?]]></question>
      <answer><![CDATA[A tandem skydive will consist of 30 to 60 seconds of freefall time, depending on the altitude you jump from, followed by a 4-5 minute parachute glide to earth landing on the airport. On a static line jump your parachute will be inflated 5 seconds after you leave the airplane, and from there you will enjoy a 4-5 minute glide to the earth safely landing in the student field.]]></answer>
